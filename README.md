## UX

### Project Goal
* The project goal is to create a fully functioning and responsive game using JavaScript.

## DESIGN CHOICES

### Colors
- The space background image inspired the color palette of the website and links to the theme of the game. 
- The headings and body text are white to ensure clear contrast and readability for the user.
- Background of the header and footer is a light purple to ensure clear contrast and delineation between sections.
- All text and icon elements have a semi-transparent purple background to ensure the text has contrast from the background.
- The icons are green to add contrast from the purple palette.

### Typography
- The logo and headings use ZCOOL QingKe HuangYou and body text uses Open Sans with a fall-back font of san-serif.
- The choice of fonts were selected using [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/).
- The headings decrease in size to ensure full responsiveness of the website.

### Images/Icons
- The background image matches with the space theme of the game and creates a sense of depth without disrupting the foreground.

- The rules video provides a clear diagram of the game moves and results.

- The icons are used consistently across the site for game controls and in the rules.

### Animations

- The close and quit buttons help to easily navigate between areas of the website.
### Game Score Area
- The game score area shows the icons of each user and their move. The score increments and a message is displayed to show the user the result of their move.


### Game Controls 
- The controls are buttons with hand icons to easily distinguish between each control.
- If on a smaller screen size, the buttons will respond by stacking on each other.


### Game Rules
- The user has a choice of image or info graphic table to refer to when learning the moves.



### Feedback Form

### Footer
- This footer includes links to the relevant social media sites for game development group who created the site. The links will open to a new tab to allow easy navigation for the user.
- First time users and returning users will be able to connect with players via social media.


### Error
- This page was created in case of any broken links or issues. It is styled the same as the rest of the site for familiarity for the user.

### Features for Future Development
- Future opportunities for the game include adding a high score function to be able to compete with other users and allowing scores to be saved once a user returns to play again.
- Audio for the game when a user wins or loses can add more interest.
- Adjusting the 'It's a win/lose/tie' text to be insults from Sheldon Cooper himself.
